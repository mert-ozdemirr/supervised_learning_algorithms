# Supervised Learning Models: Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree

This project explores three supervised learning models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Tree) applied to different datasets, focusing custom implementation for Logistic Regession and sklearn-based implementation for SVM and Decision Trees.

Key Components:
* Logistic Regression (from scratch) – Implemented without using external machine learning libraries like sklearn, showcasing its mathematical foundation and weight updates. Applied to the Portuguese Bank Marketing Dataset (numeric, random subsampled).
* Support Vector Machine (SVM) (using sklearn) – A margin-based classifier applied to the Portuguese Bank Marketing Dataset for binary classification.
* Decision Tree (using sklearn) – A tree-based model trained on the Weights & BMI Dataset (6-class classification problem) to explore interpretability and hierarchical decision-making.

This project provides a hands-on approach to understanding supervised classification techniques and comparing their effectiveness.
